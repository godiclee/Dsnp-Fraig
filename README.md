# Functionally Reduced And-Inverter Graph (FRAIG)
This is the final project of Data Structure and Programming (DSNP) in National Taiwan University (NTU)


This program provides the following functionalities:
1.  Parsing the circuit description file in the AIGER format
2.  Sweeping out the gates that cannot be reached from primary outputs. After this operation, all the gates that are       originally “defined-but-not-used” will be deleted.
